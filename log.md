# What is this?

This is a log of my progress as I manage this project. External project managment platforms exsist, but since this is a smaller project and a solo project, it will be easier for me to manage (and actually use) if the log exsists in the project.

## The Plan

Inspired by the [Thinking in React](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/thinking-in-react) page in the documentation, my plan for completing this app is:

1. ✔︎ Break Down the UI into Component Hierarchy (This was done in class in group).
   ![Diagram of Component Hierarchy](./assets/component%20tree-2.jpg "Component Hierarchy")

1. ✔︎ Create static version

   1. ✔︎ Create card component
   1. ✔︎ Create Cart component
   1. ✔︎ Create Checkout component
   1. ✔︎ Style page layout

1. Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state
1. Identify where your state should live
1. Add inverse data flow
